# Electronic Guide Dog Project

![Our Design](https://github.com/HaotianShan/guidedog/blob/main/gd.jpg?raw=true)

## Introduction

There are approximately 17 million visually impaired individuals in China, but there are fewer than 800 guide dogs available. A large guide dog training center can only "graduate" up to 40 guide dogs per year. The long training time and high costs make it difficult to meet the needs of the visually impaired community.

With the development of modern machine learning technology, the creation of electronic guide dogs has become possible. Improving the lives of people with disabilities using technology and making travel more convenient for the visually impaired are pressing social issues that need to be addressed.

This project, which incorporates traffic light & street signs classification and obstacle detection in the development of an electronic guide dog, is supported by Sensetime, a leading AI software company.

## Project Goals

- Develop an electronic guide dog to assist visually impaired individuals
- Utilize machine learning techniques (CNN) for traffic light & street signs classification and obstacle detection
- Improve the lives of people with disabilities using technology
- Key Features
    * Traffic light & street signs classification
    * Obstacle detection
